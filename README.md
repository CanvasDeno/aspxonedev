![statusbadge](https://img.shields.io/badge/project_version-_v.1_(beta)-blue)

## What and Why?

This project is currently in **beta and it is being tested.** For now, you can use [**Aspxone-Builder app.**](https://aspxone-builder.lovable.app)

This project is going to have support for much more than Razor:
* TypeScript
* ERB (Ruby)
* PHP
* JavaScript
* and more!

It will allow you to build frontend interfaces using **Tailwind CSS!** for languages and formats other than the standard of **.cshtml/Razor**

---
This project aims at making **frontend UI/UX development easier.** So developers can focus more on the **logic, backend and fixing any bugs.**

This project will be finished and deployed to the internet **soon.** But for now, you can **locally test it by your browser.**

## How to test?

You need to **fork** this project in order to test it.

Here are 2 ways to do this:

**Git HTTPS:** Open up your native/remote Git client and type this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CanvasDeno/aspxonedev.git
```

**gh shell:** Open up the gh shell and type this:

```gh
gh repo clone CanvasDeno/aspxonedev
```

And run the **index.html** file with a browser in the **folder of the forked repository**
